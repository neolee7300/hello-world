ToDo:  Setup passwordless trusted host.


Test 1.  Input following commands in bash

# Set git to use the credential memory cache
git config --global credential.helper cache

# Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

Test results: It seems work.  I will try pushing again after one hour to see whether the password expires as the setting.

The cached password expired after one hours.
